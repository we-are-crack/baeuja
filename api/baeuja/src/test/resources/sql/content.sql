It was reborn as a song, and the powerful voices of the aespa members and the variety of songs stand out.

In addition, the lyrics contain an interesting world-view story about a journey to the ''KWANGYA'' to find the ''Black Mamba'' that disrupted the ''SYNK'' of aespa and the avatar ''ae'' and threw the world into chaos.

Previously, aespa made its debut with ''Black Mamba'' in November last year, recording the shortest 100 million views in the history of a K-pop group''s debut song music video, as well as the US Billboard and China''s largest music site QQ Music. It has been proven, and there is a lot of anticipation for the performance to be shown with this new song.', 'https://cdn.k-peach.io/thumbnail/contents/21.png', '4TWR90KJl84', '2025-07-22 00:00:00', '2025-07-22 00:00:00');

1157 days full comeback
BIGBANG WITH MADE SERIES

2012 ALIVE bright May 1, 2015,
MADE''s perfect series [M] BIGBANG is with us.

Starting with [M] to be released on May 1, M, A, D, and E projects will be released each month for 4 months, and the completed [MADE] album will be available in September.

Each project released every month is not a simple digital single release, but a project single album containing one or more songs.

The diverse and successful activities of the members made us miss and look forward to seeing the full BIGBANG again.
If the influence of ''Big Bang'' is what each member has shown before, it will be difficult for anyone to imagine the destructive power of the result that the five ''Big Bang'', who returned as a whole, will show.

What a long-awaited Big Bang. As much as the fans and the public were desperate, so did BIGBANG themselves, and they were curious.
It was difficult for them to predict the appearance of BIGBANG themselves, who worked hard to grow every moment.
What meaning can this comeback after 3 years give to BIGBANG, themselves and us?

The world tour teaser trailer, announcing the start of Big Bang''s comeback, is reminiscent of a blockbuster movie, raising expectations.
This may imply that one ''movie'' called Big Bang started in 2015.
Each of the eyes, voices, and gestures of a 10-year-old artist probably melted their individuality and philosophy, so wouldn''t all this naturally be made into a movie?

Our job as spectators is to watch BIGBANG as they are and be prepared to enjoy their music. The beginning of the MADE series, [M]. It''s time to see the results.', 'https://cdn.k-peach.io/thumbnail/contents/23.png', '1CTced9CMMk', '2025-07-22 00:00:00', '2025-07-22 00:00:00');

Released on October 10th to commemorate her IU''s 10th anniversary, the digital single ''Beep'' is IU''s first challenge since her debut, an Alternative R&B-style song that rudely breaks the line in her relationship. It contains a pleasant and concise warning message to those who are over it. This song can be the story of all modern people living in these days, when healthy bonds between equal and independent individuals who do not control or define others by their own standards are more important than ever.
 
IU, who debuted at the young age of 16 through the classic classic ballad song ''Mia'', has been a unique musician and artist in the current music industry, with her musical capabilities that transcend genre boundaries and her colorful charms that do not know the limits for the past 10 years.
